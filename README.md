# Outline
 My outline for liftoff
 
 Kelsey Miller

1.	I want to make an application that will provide randomly generated at home workouts to users
2.	Features
   a. User log in
   b. Enable separate databases of workouts that work specific areas of the body so users can 
      pick "leg day" or "Arm day" etc.
   c. A "Build Your Own Workout" function
   d. An option for various at home workout equipment to add more workout options.

3.	Technologies will be: Java, SQL, Springboot, Thymeleaf templates, and java script
4.	I will have to learn Java Script and SQL.  I will have to learn how to apply all of this to springboot.  I also would have to learn how to make a search engine.
